# Tools to set up:

1. For our communication, let's use **Discord** (I considered Slack, but it gets complicated for invitees):
   - https://discord.com/download
   - Join the following Server: https://discord.gg/MD5yeTaZ
   - Join the voice chat by clicking on _General_:
     {{< image src="/voice-chat.png" alt="voice-chat" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
2. You'll need a version of **Among Us**:
   - If you have a Windows machine, I recommend buying the game for $5: https://buy.among.us/
   - If you don't... It's more complicated. It's probably best to set up an Android Emulator on your MacOS and play the mobile version. Check out instructions here: https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/how-to-play-among-us-on-mac

# Preparation for the game

Among us is a very simple game that lives from the interaction between the players.
To get the most out of it, it's worth having a look at it before we play to not have to care about the (very simple) key bindings, etc.
To be ideally prepared, I recommend:

- Watching this 4-minute intro video that broadly explains the game: {{< youtube muqaBob6pfw >}}
- Start a freeplay game on your own to get familiar with the controls, take a walk in the first map, complete some tasks to see how they look like, and even set yourself to be an impostor (you can change settings at the PC next to your spawning location): {{< image src="/freeplay.png" alt="voice-chat" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
- If you're very motivated, you can go to YouTube and find millions of strategy videos. But I didn't do that, so please don't do that neither ;-)

That's all!
